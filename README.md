### IEEE-SSCS.
# Vision:
*  To create a community of engineers who are well qualified to play an important     role in the development of the electronics industry worldwide 
# Mission:
* IEEE-SSCS Alexandria Student Chapter "IEEE SSCS ALEX SC" is formed to meet the needs of undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in thr field of electroincs and allof its related topics. Exploting the growing interest and successive developments in the electroincs filed in Egypt, the chapter holds aseries of events and activities that aims at providing the future electroincs engineers with the knwledge and skills they need to cope uo with the daily advancing technologies.
